My approach was to use as less libraries as possible and trying not to have code I don't use.

The only one I've been using was jQuery to establish the connection between your API and my code.

Having a background on both Back-end and Front End I've tried to focus on both of them.

#Style
The html is linked to the minified version for faster access. 
The other one is structure for development.
Media queries are for the most popular platforms and I didn't want to spend too much time on it. Of course it will be easier to add other platforms.

#Scripts
The html is executing the JavaScript file without comments, again, for faster access.
The other JS file has comments, so that other developers could easily understand the code.

#Performance
The difference between minified and non-minified files is not big, but it's a good practice and it will more noticeable as the project grows.
