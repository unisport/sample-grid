Here you have my version on how this project can be done in 2 ways, the first one i did all the data got pulled into a table instead of a "grid/collums" wich also works with a very nice modern design over the tables, the second one i did, also have got a little bit more work on the design than the table version.

The things i have used in this project is:
Bootstrap,
jquery,
javaScript,
JSON,
HTML,
CSS

Fork this project and send back a pull request.

1. Display these products http://www.unisport.dk/api/sample/ in a responsive grid, it has to look nice on mobile and desktop
2. Difference between price_old and price should be shown as a discount, how is up to you

Extras
Add a function that sorts the list of products based on lowest price first.

What we look for?
When we review your pull request we look at how the code has been structured and which libraries you decide to use to do the task. There is no right or wrong when it comes to choice in CSS or JavaScript frameworks or libraries
